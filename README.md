## Description

This project is a clone of Netflix. It uses ReactJS for the front-end and Express, Node.js for the Backend API as well as MongoDB for the Backend database. I have used Firebase authentication for implementing the Login and Signup features.

## Features:

### 1) Login:
      Users can login if their account already exists. This authentication process is handled by Firebase.
   
### 2) Signup:
      Users can signup for their account by registering with a valid email and password. After registration, the user will automatically be redirected to the login page, where they can enter their credentials and enter the website.
      
### 3)
